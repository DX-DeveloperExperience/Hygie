# Hygie

## Motivation

**_Hygie_** is an easy-to-use Open-Source REST API allowing you to interact with GIT events.

This [NestJs](https://docs.nestjs.com/) API expose a set of customizable Rules to automate your project's life cycle and ensure that your team respect your good practices.

## Prerequisite

This API is available for [Github](https://github.com) and [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) repositories.

Other Git version control systems will maybe available in the future. Do not hesitate to ask for one of them.

## Quick Getting Started

To use our solution, just [register your application](./guide/registerToken.md): this will create a _webhook_ in your repository and an `Connected to Hygie!` issue, to ensure that everything worked fine.

You can now create your configuration file to fit your needs, or continue working on your project without any changes and using our default configuration file, with our _good practices_.

For more informations, read the [Getting Started section](./guide/gettingStarted.md).
